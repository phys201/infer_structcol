The foundation of the generative model is a stochastic multiple scattering algorithm included in a separate python package at https://github.com/manoharan-lab/structural-color.

    "This model predicts the reflectance and transmittance spectra of structurally colored samples of thin films made from nanoscale spheres in a disordered packing. Past models have accounted for only a single scattering event in the sample [1], but this model uses a Monte Carlo approach to account for many scattering events, leading to more accurate results. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. A user-specified number of photon packets is created with an initial position, direction of propagation, and weight.\n",
    "2. The photon packets travel a step size sampled from a distribution based on Beer's law [2], and their positions are updated. \n",
    "3. The photon packet weights are updated to account for the light absorbed during the step.\n",
    "4. The photon packets are scattered after traveling the initial step, and new directions are sampled from the phase function, which is the angular distribution of the scattered intensity [3].\n",
    "5. The step size is then sampled again and the process of scattering and stepping is repeated many times as specified by the user.\n",
    "6. After the simulation is completed, reflectance and transmittance are calculated by counting the photon packets that exit the sample in the backscattering and forward hemisphere respectively, accounting for Fresnel reflection at all interfaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each simulation sends in a user-specified number of photon packets at the surface of the sample film. To calculate the reflectance, the number of photon packets that exit the sample through the backscattering hemisphere is divided by the total number of photon packets sent into the sample. Analogously, transmittance is calculated by dividing the number of photon packets that exit the sample through the forward hemisphere by the total number of packets sent into the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "A model sample consists of an infinitely wide film of a finite thickness. The code also accounts for reflections due to the index contrast at the interface using the Fresnel equations. Refraction of the backscattered light exiting the sample is calculated using Snell's law, so that the angle of photons exiting the sample can be tracked in case the user is only interested in collecting a certain angle range of light.

    "##### Basic generative model\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the generative model is to calculate reflectance and transmittance spectra from structural color samples defined by a set of parameters. The multiple scattering model described above generates theoretical spectra but these spectra do not correspond to experimental measurements. The full generative model incorporates the multiple scattering calculations as well as additional factors to produce reflectance and transmittance spectra that resemble experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the arguments taken by the multiple scattering model can be reliably measured for typical samples, except for particle volume fraction $\\phi$, which is included in the generative model as an inference parameter. The multiple scattering model returns theoretical reflectance and transmittance calculations, $R^t(\\lambda, \\phi)$ and $T^t(\\lambda, \\phi)$, where $\\lambda$ is the light wavelength at which reflectance and transmittance are calculated. A spectrum $\\left \\{ R^t(\\phi) \\right \\}$ or $\\left \\{ T^t(\\phi) \\right \\}$ consists of a set of $R^t_i(\\lambda_i, \\phi)$ or $T^t_i(\\lambda_i, \\phi)$ values, where $\\left \\{ \\lambda_i \\right \\}$ represents all wavelengths used to produce the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical reflectance $R^t$ and transmittance $T^t$ must be transformed into a corrected reflectance $R^c$ and transmittance $T^c$ before it can be compared with experimental data. Frequently, not all of the incident light on a non-absorbing sample is recorded as being reflected or transmitted since some light is lost in the experimental system. Since the exact reasons for loss are not known, they cannot be accurately measured. Instead, we parameterize a constant loss level $l_0$ with a linear modulation by wavelength with strength $l_1$, so that total losses $L_i = l_0 + l_1\\lambda_i$. Therefore corrected spectra $\\left \\{ R^c(\\phi) \\right \\}$ and $\\left \\{ T^c(\\phi) \\right \\}$ are given by the elementwise product of $\\left \\{ R^t\\left(\\phi\\right) \\right \\}$ or $\\left \\{ T^t\\left(\\phi\\right) \\right \\}$ and $\\left \\{ 1-L_i \\right \\}$, or:\n",

Also, note that the loss parameters are different for reflectance and transmittance. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generative model extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways that the model could be extended in future work. A potential extension involves increasing the amount of information that goes into the multiple scattering calculation by allowing parameters to vary that are currently held fixed. Examples include sphere polydispersity and incident beam divergence, both of which are currently fixed at zero. Both values could be measured experimentally or sampled as parameters and marginalized over in an inference calculation. This would help to make the generative model more physical by accounting for phenomena that are currently neglected. "

    "\n",
    "Due to the stochastic nature of the multiple scattering model, a calculated spectrum has uncertainties that must be included and propagated in the generative model. In general, these uncertainties will depend on the number of trajectories and scattering events we choose for a single calculation, and on the total number of runs we perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the number of scattering events is determined by the \"equilibration\" time for the scattering calculations. This means that we need enough scattering events such that most of the photons exit the sample, which would resemble more closely the behavior of light in an experimental measurement. The default setting is 200 scattering events, which was found to result in equilibration for the specific set of sample parameters that we used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of trajectories will affect the noise level and reproducibility of the resulting spectra. The more trajectories we use, the less noisy and more reproducible the data. From previous calculations, we found that choosing 10,000 trajectories leads to very reproducible results; however, we also want to reduce the computation time of each run such that the later inference calculations are computationally accessible. Therefore, we decided to use 300 trajectories per run. The uncertainty range (set to 1 standard deviation) across the spectrum of visible wavelengths calculated from 100 of these runs is\n",

The highest theoretical packing for spheres is 74%, which corresponds to face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) crystal structures. Since the samples of interest in this model are amorphous, their volume fraction will always be less than 0.74 [5]. On the other hand, the samples exhibit structural color, which require some degree of packing. Experimentally, samples that have a volume fraction lower than 0.35 do not show noticeable structural color peaks in their reflection spectra. Therefore, the prior for the volume fraction is given by a uniform probability over the interval:\n",

This is not nearly sufficient to achieve a representative sampling of parameter values or even to 'burn-in', so the output will be highly dependent on the initial parameter distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We show traces of each parameter, as well as the log-probability over the walkers' trajectories. The traces are not particularly informative for such a small number of short trajectories. The main takeaway is that the walkers have not equilibrated over 20 steps (most visible in the plots of $l_0$ and $\\log(p)$), and so the sparse distributions obtained do not truly represent the posterior probability. For this reason, we do not report most probable values from this calculation, since they would not be physically meaningful."
